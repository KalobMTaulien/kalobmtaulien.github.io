					<h1 class='title'>About Me</h1>

					<p>
						I am a senior developer turned entrepreneur. With over 17 years of development experience, and the better part of a decade of business (startup) experience, it's safe to say I'm pretty good with web technologies and assessing ideas, and turning ideas into working companies. #HumbleBrag
					</p>

					<p>
						A secret "skill" of mine is the ability to turn an idea into a scalable company while keeping expenses very low. I initially launched Arkmont.com, my newest venture in EdTech, with little more than my laptop and $50. I can now run the entire school for just a couple hundred dollars per month, including self-hosted videos with measured and priced bandwidth. The MVP for Arkmont is a fully functional system that can easily outperform most other EdTech platforms, and I did it alone in 3 months. This includes video encoding services, hosting, payment management, discussions, full course management, search, profiles, SEO, scalability, data redundancy plans and several CDN's.
					</p>

					<p class='lead'>Development</p>

					<p>
						I started developing websites in 1999 and have personally created over 500 hand-made websites that range from small business to reliable enterprise level solutions. From small and highly personalized websites to full social media-like websites such as Twitter and Facebook that require scaling. 
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Note: I am no longer accepting web development contracts. That means I will not be building you a website or application. I have great connections that can take care of your needs, however this stage of my life is behind me.</strong>
					</p>

					<p class='lead'>Business</p>
					<p>
						In 2012 I founded my first company, Kalast.com, a hybrid marketing and social system made exclusively for small business owners. In 2013 it was acquired by Everyday Communities and acts as the base for their business marketplace.
					</p>
					<p>
						In 2013 I created a real-time and dynamic email advertising system called Footrr. Footrr lets you start an advertising campaign that reaches people directly in their inboxes with no competing ads. The ads can change at any time so an email sent 3 months ago can have a modern and relevant advert, instead of something that's no longer applicable to the viewer. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Nearing the end of 2015 I created a real-time web analytics project called Pryme Analytics that caters to the needs of technology startups. The idea is to give people with minimal time to spend on data analyzing the ability to quickly look at their incoming traffic sources and determine which methods are working best. No more difficult learning curves and no more waiting 24 hours for data to aggregate and become accessible. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Pryme is not currently unavailable. It was an big data and web analytics platform I made for a separate venture to track the exact data we required, then I made the interface accessible to the public and soon there were several hundred startups using the service. Pryme was a free analytics service, and I've temporarily closed it in order to allow myself more time with Arkmont. 
					</p>

					<p class='lead'>Education</p>
					<p>
						Education is very important to me. I learned basic HTML and programming fundamentals before the age of 10 and I enjoy giving back and teaching programming fundamentals to others.
					</p>		
					<p>
						In fact, I would say education is so important to me (and the future of humanity), that I went beyond creating online courses. Education is the only way humanity has been able to move forward, and will continue to be the only way humans continue to make progress towards a better and brighter future. That's a reason why I decided to launch Arkmont.com -- education for the masses, taught by people who have the skills.
