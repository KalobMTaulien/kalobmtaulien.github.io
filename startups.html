							<a class="course-link" href="https://xcelleratortools.com/" target="_blank">https://xcelleratortools.com/</a>

							<p>Xcellerator helps Amazon FBA sellers never run out of stock by adjusting the quantity of items they order from their manufacturers and when the orders should take place.</p>

							<p>This service works with numerous API's, including Amazon Marketplace Web Services. The company is registered in the United Kingdom.</p>

							<h3>Footrr</h3>
							<a class="course-link" href="https://footrr.com/" target="_blank">https://footrr.com/</a>

							<p>Footrr allowed anyboy to add an <code>img</code> HTML tag to their email signatures and instantly start serving advertisements via email. The image dynamically changed every time it was loaded based on ranking algorithms. Users made 30% of the CPC bid and were paid via PayPal.</p>

							<p>The service became very popular in India, and eventually Footrr was spending more time fighting fraud than it was growing the business. The cost of running Footrr with all the fraud became too high, and after 2 years it was time to shut down.</p>

							<p>I was the founder and CEO.</p>

							<h3>Kalast</h3>
							<a class="course-link" href="https://kalast.com/" target="_blank">https://kalast.com/</a>

							<p>Kalast is a small business marketplace with an exclusive social aspect, built just for small business owners. The all-in-one loyalty card allows users to
							throw out all their other loyalty cards and stamp cards, and use the custom branded Kalast card (or just their phone number instead). Customers can give
							businesses reviews, and businesses can leave notes on customers, track their Kalast-driven customers and put their business online with a strictly
							business-only profile.</p>


							<p>I was the founder and CEO at Kalast, Inc. until August 2014 when it was acquired by Everyday Communities.</p>
