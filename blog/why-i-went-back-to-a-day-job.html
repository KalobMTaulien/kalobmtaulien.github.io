								<p>
									For those of you who don't know, I've started and sold companies, started tonnes of high potential
									projects, I've taught web development online to almost 10,000 people, and worked several different jobs,
									from web contracts to sales to skilled labour. 
								</p>
								<p>
									But this article isn't about that -- it's about why I left the work force to start my own companies
									and why I ultimately decided to come back. 
								</p>
								<p>
									This story starts with my first venture. To keep things simple, we'll keep names out of it. 
									I left my <em>awesome</em> job in a machine shop to start my own startup. I was nervous as hell because
									I didn't know if it was the right move, if I was just being a tad overzealous or if I was just being an 
									idiot. It didn't matter, because I made the leap--I handed in my resignation and never looked back. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Like all startups, this one had it's fair share of hurdles and problems. A lot of lessons were learned,
									and that was the most important aspect of that venture.
								</p>
								<p>
									After almost 2 years, I sold the startup and moved on to my next "big thing". It wasn't actually <em>my</em>
									idea. I was just the techy who made the systems work. The label was CTO or something like that. With this 
									company, I lacked a lot of control. In fact, I lacked so much control I'm pretty certain I started experiencing
									serious anxiety. Not because I'm a control freak, but because things were going so wrong even after I gave the 
									founders the solution to common problems. But I wasn't a founder, so my thoughts and ideas were discounted and thrown
									in the cheap bin. 
								</p>
								<p>
									But while <em>all</em> of this was going on, I had a bigger idea in my head. An idea for a digital school,
									something unlike anything I've ever seen online. But the market wasn't ready, the idea needed more thought, 
									it needed user validation, it needed an MVP and it needed leadership. But the biggest ingredient was <em>time</em>.
								</p>
								<p>
									The idea would take years to develop, and I did things the long way (since I had time). I spoke to university teachers,
									high school teachers, elementary teachers, online educators (big and small) and people who like learning online. I asked 
									for feedback on my ideas, received a lot of "that's a bad idea" and even more "I love it!"'s. 
								</p>
								<p>
									During this time, I was also taking on web contract. I'd make websites for people--whatever they wanted I could whip up
									with very little overhead and my life-long experience as a developer let me work at incredible speeds. I took on 
									enough work to get by. Some months were harder than others, but this lifestyle let me continue building out my ideas. 
									Arkmont was the biggest idea I had, but I also built a web analytics service, a dynamic email advertising service and a few others.
									Everything I worked on was for a reason: to learn.
								</p>
								<p>
									Yesterday I launched Arkmont.com. Nothing big, because I don't believe in "big launches" anymore, but a nice soft launch to start 
									exposing Arkmont.com to the public. And exactly 2 weeks before is when I started my new day job. 
								</p>
								<p>
									So if you're in the startup world, you're probably thinking "What the fuck, Kalob! Why would you start a new job when 
									you're launching a new startup right away?!" You'd be sane to ask that question. That's a great question. 
									And I have no doubt in my mind that I made the right decision. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Here's why I decided to take a day job, instead of jumping in both feet first with Arkmont.com: I have complete faith in 
									Arkmont.com--more than I've ever had in all my other ideas and ventures. But through all my other ventures, I've learned
									the truth behind success... Never stop learning! 
								</p>
								<p>
									I've spent around half a decade being the "smartest person in the room" (generally speaking; exceptions apply). 
									This isn't a brag session; it's meant to highlight the fact that I haven't learned as much as I could have. While I 
									have learned a lot, from marketing, to internal processes, to sales, to bookkeeping--I'm a totally different person 
									because of all that knowledge and my experiences that have taught me. 
								</p>
								<p>
									But it's not enough.
								</p>
								<p>
									If you ever find yourself in a position where you aren't learning something new every day, it's time for a change. 
									So what did I do? I went out looking for a company that could make me feel like an idiot (in a good way) compared 
									to their people. But this certain company can't just have skilled people, it needs to have a great growth culture,
									with <em>good</em> people. I turned down an interview with the City of Edmonton because I <em>knew</em> they couldn't 
									offer me anything more than money and a little experience. 
								</p>
								<p>
									The place I ended up working at <em>has</em> a fantastic culture, <em>a lot</em> of great people who are positive, 
									helpful, smart and don't take life too seriously (something I have forgotten how to do in my recent years of entrepreneurship).
									I've only been here for a couple weeks, but I can tell you that what I've learned I would not have been able to learn 
									on my own. Not because I don't know how or anything like that... But because you don't know what you don't know. And that right 
									there <em>was</em> the problem. Before going back to a day job, I didn't have very many items on my list of "things 
									I don't know". Again, not bragging, but highlighting the environments I've been in lately.
								</p>
								<p>
									While most people would happily take more money and work for their city, I wanted to learn more. "Kalob, why on EARTH would 
									you do that?!". Yet another great question! Because money only helps you so much. There comes a point where money just can't 
									outperform knowledge. And with knowledge, money can go even further. In other words: I've decided to invest in myself and my 
									brain before investing in my bank account. 
								</p>
								<p>
									With a newly launched startup, time is valuable. It's more valuable than money! And I chose to give away 40 hours of my 
									weekly awake time? In a way, I'm taking a short term loss. But in the long run my new skills and knowledge will translate 
									into <em>bigger</em> and <em>better</em> things! Not everybody agrees, but this method has served me well. It served me so well 
									that I spent nearly half a decade being the "smartest person in the room". And by surrounding myself with people who can 
									out-code me, out-perform me, who have insane experience in the tech world that I haven't had yet... I can learn from them and 
									maybe help them learn something in return. 
								</p>
								<p>
									You don't know what you don't know until someone tells you, or you learn about it the hard way.
								</p>
								<p>
									I decided to go back to a day job because the knowledge I can obtain is worth more than money. And it helps that my newly launched 
									startup will most likely <em>not</em> experience Facebook-like user growth.
