                                    If somebody offers you an amazing opportunity but you are not sure you can do it, say yes â€“ then learn how to do it later!<br>
                                    - Richard Branson, Founder of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Group" target="_blank">Virgin Group</a>
                                </blockquote>
                                <p>That's the quote I'd like to start this article with. Why? Because I find there are two types of people in this world in regards to this quote. People who
                                say no because they want training first, and people who say yes and figure it out along the way.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>For the majority of my life I was a person who wanted to training first, then I'll take a new opportunity. If I didn't know how to do something, I'd learn
                                it and then apply it. And it worked great... until I realized that it takes a lifetime or two to get anywhere meaningful. So I made a conscious decision to
                                apply this quote on my next venture.</p>
                                <p>Along the way to my next venture I had some serious conversations with myself. Little did I know my next venture would actually <span style=
                                "font-style: italic;">not&nbsp;</span>be <span style="font-style: italic;">my</span>&nbsp;venture. I decided to take a step back from the CEO/Founder role and
                                apply what I'm extremely good at: rapid learning and web development/programming. Being friends with two other successful entrepreneurs who've been working on
                                an idea for quite some time, they decided to look to me as their head of software. Turns out, this is exactly what I needed to do. Did I know how to do it?
                                Nope. I had no training on being the lead role in software development. And I took on the responsibility.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>Was it an easy transition going from making most of the official decisions to stepping back and focusing on what <span style="font-style: italic;">I
                                do</span>? Not exactly. But I can tell you with all the conviction in the world that <span style="font-style: italic;">employing my strengths with others who
                                utilize their strengths has helped create a rapidly growing business</span>.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>Essentially, I stopped taking on everything and started focusing on my one, most important, skill set - development. I am a builder. Whether it's building
                                out an idea, building a software or just building an MVP. And it has turned out great so far.&nbsp;</p>
                                <h3>Adaptation is key</h3>
                                <p>Whether you agree with evolution or not is not the point of the below quote. But it highly relevant to human nature.&nbsp;</p>
                                <blockquote>
                                    It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change.<br>
                                    - Charles Darwin
                                </blockquote>
                                <p>Have I known how to do everything that's been needed so far? Absolutely not. And if I did, I would say I was the wrong person for the job.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>I've adapted. Then re-adapted. And re-adapted some more. And this will probably continue forever. For some people, this will cause a lot of stress and
                                ultimately lead to you realizing that you're not ready for a position where adaptation is key - that will come in time, I have no doubt about that!&nbsp;</p>
                                <h3>What I've learned so far</h3>
                                <p>Being in this new role that I'm well suited for, I've learned that <span style="font-style: italic;">you will make mistakes</span>&nbsp;and <span style=
                                "font-style: italic;">you will need to adapt quickly</span>. Mistakes are inevitable, so make the most from them. If you make the same mistake twice, you need
                                to take some serious time out of your personal time (not work time) to learn the solution.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>By adapting quickly, you'll need to know how to learn. Rewrite the knowledge in your brain with new knowledge and don't look back. Easier said than done, I
                                understand. You also need to learn alternative solutions. Not everything has one answer. Sometimes one problem has two, three or even ten solutions. From
                                there, it's simply understanding the pros and cons of each solution and using the best one. And sometimes you'll be wrong. Other times situations will change
                                and you'll need to swap one solution for another. But you <span style="font-style: italic;">need to act fast</span>.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>If you're in a startup you'll also need to know what is possible, even if you don't know how to do it, and immediately learn how to do it. For example, say
                                your founder says "I want to be able to search through blog post content based on my sentence. Show me the 5 most relevant posts." There is more than one way
                                to look for his sentence, but you need to know which one is best. For a lot of developers, they wouldn't know every method to use but they'll know it's
                                possible. Here's where the most important skill comes in: knowing how to learn. Don't know how to do something? Learn and learn quick.&nbsp;</p>
                                <h3>Push yourself</h3>
                                <p>If you learn just one thing from this article, I hope you learn to push yourself. Athletes break records all the time. They break their own records. And
                                then they push some more. That's how to go from good to great. Regardless of what you're working on, you need to push yourself. Sometimes that's harder to do
                                than simply trying new things. I'm lucky to have a couple of great founders in the startup we're working on who require new parts of software to be added all
                                the time and lots of it pushes me to a new level.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>Just keep moving forward. And the best way to do that is to say yes to an opportunity and figure out how to do it later. When you make that switch from
                                "learning then accepting" to "accepting then learning" you'll grow yourself and your skills at pace that can only be slowed down by you. You'll have no other
                                barriers but you - and that's a good thing!</p>
