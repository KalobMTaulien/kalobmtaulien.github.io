								<p>There are <span style="font-style: italic;">a lot</span>of new startup founders and co-founders every month. Literally thousands of new startups are
								founded every month and more often than not, they are founded by people who are... for lack of a better description... afraid to charge their customers. So for
								many people you need to <span style="font-style: italic;">know</span>that charging your customer is good for them <span style=
								"font-style: italic;">and</span>you. Here's why..</p>

								<h3>You need to grow.</h3>

								<p>Your business cannot exist for very long off your savings and smiles. I'm not telling you this as a friend, I'm telling you this as a person who would like
								to see businesses of all types succeed. How long do you think you can live off of a free user base? It might be quite long - but as more users come in, the
								more expensive everything becomes. I know for a fact that a tonne of people are saying "well, we'll just get investment money". Easier said than done when you
								aren't earning anything and your total number of users are growing exponentially every week.</p>

								<p>How can you continue to serve your users in 3 months if you can't pay for the servers?</p>

								<h3>There's value in charging.</h3>

								<p>When you think of buying something, anything, do you always think free is better? If you were asked if you'd rather have a car valued at $60,000 or a car
								valued at $0 (free), which would you choose? Simple, the $60,000 every time. When you go to a restaurant and you look at the menu options and see $40 beside
								every choice, you start thinking, "<span style="font-style: italic;">This better be one damn good meal for this price.</span>" It's no coincidence that "free
								giveaways" always say "valued at *insert price*".</p>

								<p>Do people always want to pay for a service? No, of course not. But if you have something they really need (do your market research) then you need to be
								charging - and if they don't pay they either: aren't the right people or you don't have the right solution for them. Simply put, if they see value, they will
								pay.</p>

								<h3>Don't overcharge.</h3>

								<p>You don't need to charge too much. Charging more doesn't always mean there's more perceived value behind your product/service. That's more of a branding
								thing (think Wal-Mart vs. Lamborghini). But certainly charge enough to cover your customer service, development, expenses, etc. and a bit more for some real
								profit.</p>

								<h3>So what do you do?</h3>

								<p>First, don't be scared to ask for the money. It's not being greedy, it's growing your business and creating sustainability in order to continue to serve
								your customers. Then you go above an beyond for them. Make them happy, give them a solution they need, and they'll stick around.</p>

								<p>Second, consider yourself as a consumer in the industry you're entering. Would you buy right away? Would you want to step inside for a few minutes and take
								a peak? Maybe you want someone to contact you just to say hi and make the transaction a little less lonely? Consider what you'd want first and once you have
								customers rolling in, start talking to them. After all, they know what they want better than you do at the start.</p>

								<p>Third, practice the sale. Just ask for it. Put it on your website. Put it in your webinars. Practice on your friends and family. Put it in your phone calls.
								It's <span style="font-style: italic;">really</span>not that hard to say "Can I get you started today and have you set up in the next 2 minutes?".</p>

								<p>Fourth, just keep at it and keep charging your customers. There's not much a company can't solve by increasing the number of sales.</p>
