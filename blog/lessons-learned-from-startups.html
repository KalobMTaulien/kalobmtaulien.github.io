								<p>For those who don't know, I've spent the last few years in various roles from, founder and CEO of a startup to more of a coaching and assistant role, with
								pretty much everything in between - because as a founder, you take on every role at the start (the way it should be, in my opinion).&nbsp;</p>
								<p>I've also hand crafted hundreds of websites, if not thousands and taught web development online.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>My first official company was sold to another company in the city it was started in and I honestly believe it's a much better fit over there than what I
								could have ever given it - and I'm only saying that because of what I know now.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>In this article I'm going to go over just a few lessons I've learned that <span style="font-style: italic;">can and will</span>&nbsp;help every new
								startup, regardless of your success history.</p>
								<p>Just so you know what you're diving into, here's what I'm going to cover (not in any particular order, just to keep things interesting):</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<a href="#audience">Know your target audience. A lesson in marketing.</a>
									</li>
									<li>
										<a href="#validate">Know how to validate. A lesson in ending before you start.</a>
									</li>
									<li>
										<a href="#sleeping">Know who you're sleeping with. A lesson in partnerships.</a>
									</li>
									<li>
										<a href="#offering">Know what you're offering. A lesson in value.</a>
									</li>
									<li>
										<a href="#mistakes">Know how to make mistakes. A lesson in learning.</a>
									</li>
									<li>
										<a href="#learn">Know how to learn. A lesson in life.</a>
									</li>
									<li>
										<a href="#sell">Know how to sell. A lesson in sustainability.</a>
									</li>
									<li>
										<a href="#prioritize">Know how to prioritize. A lesson on "trendiness".</a>
									</li>
									<li>
										<a href="#focus">Know how to focus. A lesson on skill.</a>
									</li>
									<li>
										<a href="#role">Know what your role is. A lesson as a CEO and CTO.</a>
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Before we get started, I just want to point out that the above list barely scratches the surface and that I'm very simply giving you the "low down" on how
								to get started quickly and successfully.&nbsp;</p>
								<h3><a href="#audience" id="audience" name="audience"><i class="pull-right fa fa-anchor"></i></a>
								Know your target audience.</h3>
								<h4>A lesson in marketing.</h4>
								<p>Before you start a company, startup or even start selling anything, you <span style="font-style: italic;">need</span>&nbsp;to understand who you are
								targeting. With my first company, we were told by every organization and every "experienced" business person to create a business plan and write it out. It
								should be long. Like 70+ pages long. And about 20% of that had to do with "know your audience". And yet every piece of advice I received about knowing your
								audience was either wrong, didn't matter or wasn't enough. In most cases, our audience wasn't explored very much.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>Me and my partner were told to look at their location, their age, genders and summarize their mindsets. That's a fine start, but nobody told us to dig
								deeper. Create a profile on your target audience. Create a character, on paper, about this perfect person you target. Be as specific as possible. And then
								when you're done, go and find these people and <span style="font-style: italic;">actually talk to them</span>. Get to know what they are like, get to know
								their problems and write everything down. Log it, record it, analyze it, and keep doing that. We didn't do that with my first company and it caused a lot of
								pivoting which became very expensive and very time consuming. We developed and tried and failed. Followed by a pivot, develop, trial and failure. I very
								strongly believe we could have operated much more successfully if we <span style="font-style: italic;">spoke to our audience</span>. So take your audience for
								a coffee or take them for lunch. Get in their heads. Google groups they participate in and learn about them. This will sound strange, but you need to become
								one of them without actually becoming one of them. Understand their behavior on a conscious level better than they understand their own behavior. This will
								save you massive heartbreak down the road.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>I said "be as specific as possible" for a reason. If your target audience is, for example, 200,000 people in a city with 1,000,000 people, you're not being
								specific enough. People will tell you "the more you target, the more money you will make" or "the more people you target, the bigger your business can be".
								While that's true for giants like Google, everyone started small. Target 100 very specific people. Grow from there. Once you have your first 100 customers you
								can start talking to them and understanding how they are using your product or service and create something better for the next 100 people. Doing this over
								and over is called an iteration - the most successful companies will iterate extremely fast and grow from the minor (like 2%) increases in sales or interest.
								That small percent turns into the compounding effect.</p>
								<blockquote>
									I don't know the key to success, but the key to failure is trying to please everybody.<br>
									- Bill Cosby
								</blockquote>
								<p>That quote is unbelievably true. Try this: walk into a room of 10+ people and spark a debate on politics of religion, and try to take the side of
								everybody. I bet you know what that outcome would look like.&nbsp;</p>
								<h3><a href="#validate" id="validate" name="validate"><i class="pull-right fa fa-anchor"></i></a>
								Know how to validate.</h3>
								<h4>A lesson in ending before you start.</h4>
								<p>The next most important step is validation. Do people actually want what you have? No, really.. do they? As a creative I have tonnes of ideas that I think
								are amazing. Everybody gets great ideas but that doesn't mean they are destined for greatness. Once you think you know who your perfect, specific target
								audience is, see if they want to buy. Ask.</p>
								<p>I had an idea for helping startups gain more exposure and attracting customers en mas. I thought it was absolutely brilliant! So I made a decision to speak
								to 100 new tech startup founders and see what they thought. About 98 of them loved it and I thought I was onto something great! It's at this point that most
								people just go for it. They build, incorporate, advertise and then... end up dry. 98/100 founders thought this idea was great, but is a great idea
								sustainable? Let me put this into perspective - can Facebook operate on $0? Nope. Not a chance. And neither can you or I. So I decided to reach out to another
								700 tech startup founders in the next 30 days to see if they would pay for this service, if they'd sign up if the site had ads on it instead of paying for it
								and getting an idea of how much they would want to pay.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>Guess what I came back with?&nbsp;<br>
								772/800 were in love with the idea.&nbsp;<br>
								50-60 were willing to pay a monthly or annual subscription.&nbsp;<br>
								20% of those 50-60 didn't want to pay more than $20/month for a service that would drive customers directly to them (among other benefits). Can a service like
								that run off about $200/month? Nope.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>The outcome: People loved the idea but it would ultimately fail due to lack of funds from them and us.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>The idea was scrapped.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>My point here is to validate everything you're working on. Whether it's a feature upgrade on your site, a new idea or company or anything else you can
								imagine - validate it.</p>
								<p>Since then I've learned one more valuable lesson regarding validation. <span style="font-style: italic;">Even if people say they will pay, doesn't mean
								they actually will.</span> If you want true product validation, find customers who will part with their money <span style=
								"font-style: italic;">before</span>&nbsp;you write one line of code or create your first product. It seems impossible, but if you can find a handful of
								customers in 24-48 hours that will pay you for something you haven't created yet, you're definitely onto something.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>Getting people to pay you before your product or service is available is not a new practice. I've never known anyone that did that, however, until I heard
								about my friends <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Stephen-Robert/1429399653973369" target="_blank">Stephen Somers and Robert Rickey</a>, who did this
								and made more in 3 days than most employees do in about 5 months. Nothing was coded, nothing was built, nothing was recorded. People bought into their idea
								before the idea was anything more than that.</p>
								<p>The lesson: If you cannot successfully validate your idea, it will be dead before you even start.&nbsp;</p>
								<h3><a href="#sleeping" id="sleeping" name="sleeping"><i class="pull-right fa fa-anchor"></i></a>
								Know who you're sleeping with.</h3>
								<h4>A lesson in partnerships.</h4>
								<p>Startups and businesses in general are pretty much the same as a relationship; Know who you are working with <span style=
								"font-style: italic;">very</span>&nbsp;well.&nbsp;</p>
								<blockquote>
									Running a business with a partner is like being married, without the sex.
								</blockquote>
								<p>There are a tonne of various quotes similar to the one above, and they all hold true. My first official business had two other partners, three of us total.
								One simply wasn't right for a brand new startup and the other faked it for fame. Or so it seemed.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>You can't hold anything against a person who simply isn't right for a position. There are too many personal variables to take into consideration and
								frankly, a startup requires ultimate focus, dedication and commitment. That's not easy to do.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>But for the people who will try their hardest to appease those attributes but can't actually pull their own weight... well, now you're starting to swim in
								quicksand.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>I was actually quite good friends with one of the other partners when we started the company and even went to high school with him. He's a very intelligent
								person, there's no doubt about that. But people can only fake it for so long. Or maybe "fake" is the wrong word - perhaps "commit" is a better word.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>Things were absolutely great at first - we started development and when it came time to sell the service, the business became a club house for fun and
								anything not work related. Now I'm all for that! Fun in the workplace creates great relationships - but when it comes to acquiring a customer you need to be
								more than friends with them. You need to do more than take them out for coffee and <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> ask for the sale. After all,
								we are growing a business.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>Needless to say things started going downhill, even after a few very serious heart-to-heart conversations.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>The company I'm working with today, Marketplace SuperHeroes, has two founders that I've known for a couple years now. Within that last sentence was the
								key: time. I've spent more time spit balling ideas, working on little projects and just getting to know those guys than I did with the previously mentioned
								partner throughout our entire history. Without actually putting up tests, I have noticed how reliable, committed, honest and hard working these two founders
								are. And you better start keeping track of these personal attributes (in your head), because when it's time to swim you'll need to know who's going to drown,
								who will hold you down and who's on the same level as you (or better than you).&nbsp;</p>
								<p>These guys are able to juggle a dozen tasks at once: please customers, make sales, develop formulas and still show up on time. Is that easy to do?
								Absolutely not. Do they do it? Every single day.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>It is because of people like them and myself who are completely committed to an idea, a project, a startup or a company that will ultimately create
								anything great.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>Just to repeat myself once more - know who you're sleeping with. Your venture partner(s) will make or break your company. Simple as that.&nbsp;</p>
								<h3><a href="#offering" id="offering" name="offering"><i class="pull-right fa fa-anchor"></i></a>
								Know what you're offering.</h3>
								<h4>A lesson in value.</h4>
								<p>Have serious conversations with yourself. If you're reading this, chances are you already do that. That's good; that's a strength! It's nice to be
								optimistic and to think your idea is the bees knees, but it's better to be realistic with yourself. So ask yourself a very important question.</p>
								<p>Do you really know what you're offering?&nbsp;</p>
								<p>Almost everyone will say yes, but they should be saying no. Ask a restaurant owner what they are offering - most will say food. While that's true, I don't
								go to a place just for the food. Often I'll go to a restaurant for the environment. Starbucks offers a unique environment to be in - it's a mini community in
								every location! <span style="font-style: italic;">They</span>&nbsp;know what they are offering.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>A couple years ago I was helping small businesses get more exposure locally to help increase local spending. I offered discount cards, a paperless loyalty
								program, a page to advertise their business and a way to track their customers who had these loyalty cards. Did I know what I was offering back then? I would
								have answered that question with "yes, I was offering local customer support and raising small business awareness" when really I was offering a discount card
								that they could have done themselves (sort of). Did this play a factor in that companies success? Yes! Absolutely it did! Here are some practice questions for
								you to warm up your brain.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>What does Groupon offer?</li>
									<li>What does Google offer?</li>
									<li>What are you offering?</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Let's take this conversation with yourself to the next level: how are you helping people? Did you <span style=
								"font-style: italic;">really</span>&nbsp;understand how your product or service effects their lives, in a positive manner? If so, <span style=
								"font-style: italic;">how</span> does it help them? And if you don't know, tell yourself you don't know. Be honest with yourself. If you don't know what
								you're offering or how you improve the lives of your customers, <span style="font-style: italic;">go ask them</span>. There's nothing wrong with personally
								contacting your users or customers and making sure they are happy with what they bought.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>If you don't know what you're offering, find out, otherwise someone else will realize what you truly offer and capitalize on your market.&nbsp;</p>
								<h3><a href="#mistakes" id="mistakes" name="mistakes"><i class="pull-right fa fa-anchor"></i></a>
								Know how to make mistakes.</h3>
								<h4>A lesson in learning.</h4>
								<p>You are most likely to make mistakes every day of your life. Don't take that the wrong way. 100% of all humans do it. It's the only way we know how to
								learn. Every single person on this planet learns from making mistakes. Although, some great &nbsp;lessons you will remember forever are the ones that you had
								to go through, but not every mistake needs to be yours.</p>
								<blockquote>
									It's good to learn from your mistakes. It's better to learn from other people's mistakes.<br>
									- Warren Buffett
								</blockquote>
								<p>When you make a mistake, understand what you did wrong and improve on it. Every iteration will make you better. As Warren Buffett is saying - you can learn
								from the mistakes of others.</p>
								<p>Get a mentor in your industry, pick up a book, watch helpful videos on YouTube and go talk to people. Heck, find friends that are trying to do what you're
								doing and learn from them, directly or indirectly. Just keep learning.</p>
								<p>I'm probably not nearly qualified enough to append the statement from Mr. Buffett, but if I could, I'd also tell people to learn from other people's
								achievements. Learning what they did wrong will help get you through some hard times but you should also learn what they did when others achieved success.
								What does Warren Buffett do with the money he earns? That's his success and to get to his level of success, you must understand the bad and the
								good.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>But I admit that learning from other people's mistakes is a more efficient way to reach your goals faster.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>Personally, I think about a lot of my mistakes quite often. I know they say you should "learn and move on" but I was also taught by a Buddhist Monk that
								you don't truly know a book until you've read it at least ten times. Yes, 10 times. I've applied that to mistakes. What are ten different actions you could
								have taken from each mistake? Sometimes that's a bit overkill, but it has proven to be a great strategy. I don't stress out or worry about the mistakes I've
								made - I reflect on them and improve them in my head every time I learn something new. Why? Because next time I face a problem, I've run a base solution and 9
								better, more powerful and efficient outcomes. Don't hurt yourself over this though, this is purely a reflective exercise.</p>
								<p>Think about mistakes and how to improve the outcome next time it happens. The mistakes don't have to be yours but you need to apply solutions
								immediately.&nbsp;</p>
								<h3><a href="#learn" id="learn" name="learn"><i class="pull-right fa fa-anchor"></i></a> Know how
								to learn.</h3>
								<h4>A lesson in life.</h4>
								<p>Please, don't skip this section. It's incredibly important!</p>
								<p>So many people today tell you to learn from your mistakes. Even I just told you to do the same in the section above this. But that's pointless if you don't
								know how to learn. What do I mean by this?</p>
								<p>Expand how you learn. Understand <span style="font-style: italic;">how</span> you&nbsp;learn. Figure out the best method to learn.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>Everybody is different and everybody learns in a different manner. For me, I'm a highly visual and logical person - I need to be able to see something in
								my head. Whether that's a floor schematic I've drawn in my head before putting it on paper, or creating a flow chart to make a users flow through a website
								clearer. Some people learn from audio, reading, teaching, talking or doing.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>Here's a less common fact about university: university, and school in general, is not designed to teach you everything in life - instead it is designed to
								teach you how to learn through different methods.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>Remember writing papers? What about giving speeches in front of the class? What about dioramas? Prototypes? And the research behind all of that - did you
								Google it? Use the library? Ask professionals? How did you present it?</p>
								<p>We have been prepped to learn how to learn in the real world from school since your first day in school. We've been pushed to learn in every environment.
								All you need to do is understand which method you prefer and utilize that one the most. Life will throw you lessons in the form of adversities. Learn from
								others mistakes, as I previously mentioned. But know how to adapt and learn from everything around you.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>As a developer and the head of software, I need to learn by doing a lot of reading and practice. Well, reading isn't best suited for me. So I visualize
								everything by creating hypothetical scenarios and applying what I've been reading to them, followed by practical experience.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>From a startup point of view, you need to learn from everyone. Seriously, everyone. From your aunt who runs a little shop around the corner to Elon Musk
								and Jeff Bezos. As a former founder and a current developer, I learn from everyone who I'm around. Sometimes it comes off as being quiet or inattentive but I
								can assure you that I'm either listening and learning or solving a problem in my head (usually the former).&nbsp;</p>
								<p>I have two great founders that have literally created a successful business out of thin air. I have skill they don't have, and they each have skills I
								don't have. Since I spend most of my time with them now, I try to mine as much as I can while performing my duties as the head of software. I listen to
								successful people and read books from and about them.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>And ask questions. Don't worry about asking dumb questions. Dumb questions are only dumb if you need to ask more than once (or sometimes twice) and we all
								end up doing that. But if you don't know something, <span style="font-style: italic;">ask!</span>&nbsp;Ask your mentor, your coach, your friends, your spouse
								or type it in Google or Wikipedia for a starting point.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>I have had basic labor jobs in warehouses and I understand the logistics of how they work because I asked. Did it get me anywhere? Sort of, but not really.
								But it costs me nothing to hold that information in my brain.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>Think about the way you learn best and simply start using that method more than the other methods. But don't forget to switch it up - it keeps your mind
								fresh.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>In a startup you absolutely need to know how to learn. A degree from university isn't an option when you need to learn something this week. If you can't
								adapt, find new ways to learn, new people to learn from and actually keep the information in your mind, your startup is most likely destined for
								mediocrity.&nbsp;</p>
								<h3><a href="#sell" id="sell" name="sell"><i class="pull-right fa fa-anchor"></i></a> Know how to
								sell.</h3>
								<h4>A lesson in sustainability.</h4>
								<p>I mentioned how I spoke to 800 tech startup founders. I looked at their websites, got to know <span style="font-style: italic;">a lot</span>&nbsp;of them,
								checked out their pricing and realized why so many of them said they couldn't afford to buy into a small monthly subscription that would help them acquire
								customers: they didn't have very many customers to begin with.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>You techies out there are truly brilliant. Some of the services you create blow my mind and sometimes I even think to myself, "man, this must be in
								<span style="font-style: italic;">very</span>&nbsp;high demand". But they don't tend to make much money.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>Yeah, you're probably asking this question: "Kalob, how do you know how much they are making?". Easy. Pay attention to their growth, their emails, their
								social media and any groups they've created or joined. You'll generally find one of two outcomes: they are either very quiet or making noise. If they are
								making noise in the same manner every other tech startup is, they probably aren't hitting it big yet. And if they're quiet, they either died or are too busy
								to make any public noise themselves.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>There's some crazy number like 500,000 new startups start every month (don't quote me on that). Out of 500,000 you think we'd see another Google, Facebook,
								Amazon, Netflix or other giant appear more often than we do. But we don't. And here's why: they aren't making money.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>Granted some companies focus on the user experience before focusing on making money, they still need some sustainability. Raising capital is a great way to
								focus on the user experience without needing customers to buy your service or product. But out of 500,000 startups every month, how many are raising $500,000
								right off the cuff? Not many.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>So what does a techie who just started a company do when they're bootstrapping their great idea?</p>
								<p>Free accounts.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>Or worse. A price that's so low it barely makes sense, but at least brings in a couple dollars here and there.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>Or even worse. They price their service or product at a decent and fair price - what they are obviously worth - and fail to sell. They never want to do
								sales. But selling is what you're in; that's the name of the game from <span style="font-style: italic;">before the day you started coding</span>. Do they
								need to sell a lot? No, but they should be making money from the start.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>This is not considered being greedy and you better believe that people <span style="font-style: italic;">will</span>&nbsp;pay for a service that you
								haven't created yet. Kickstarter built a business around that entire idea. And if you think this is being greedy, you need to realize one hard truth: you
								cannot serve your customers (or free users) next month if you can't pay your server bill.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>As a person who has started <span style="font-style: italic;">many</span>&nbsp;websites based on "free users" or "freemium services" I can tell you that
								sustainability should be one of the first topics that you think about when taking a new idea seriously. You could end up with tens of thousands of
								fans/customers/users and hit that giant brick wall that doesn't let you move forward. Not to mention you'll start facing the wrong type of stresses associated
								with starting a company.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>If you don't have cashflow (not a savings account - real cashflow) you are risking your efforts every single day. Get paying customers before you write a
								line of code.&nbsp;</p>
								<h3><a href="#prioritize" id="prioritize" name="prioritize"><i class=
								"pull-right fa fa-anchor"></i></a> Know how to prioritize.</h3>
								<h4>A lesson on "trendiness".</h4>
								<p>Unfortunately, this topic is yet another hard fact of life. If you've started a company or a startup, you're probably focusing on the wrong
								things.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>Many new business owners, startup founders and general business people get caught up in the hype of doing something their friends aren't doing - you've set
								out to change the world and you try all sorts of new things to get your name out there: business networking, business cards, flyers, Facebook advertising,
								YouTube advertising, Twitter, Google+, Reddit and so on.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>Here's the hard part to swallow: You're doing it all wrong. Every part of it.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>Give up being "trendy". Give up being excited about a new role, because that's all it is. Give up "being your own boss", because once you work for yourself
								everyone else because your boss (customers, employees, investors, governments, etc). Give up trying to acquire fame. Give up trying to become a billionaire.
								And give up trying to change the world overnight.</p>
								<p>Prioritize and focus - then you will succeed.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>I would argue that the most important aspect of your startup that you need to focus on more than anything is the user experience. Do they know you? Do they
								like you? Do they LOVE you? But even within the statement of "focus on the user" there are too many things to do. You won't escape being able to do everything
								at the start, but you can do everything better by doing one thing at a time. Focus yourself. Are you in need of customers? Focus on sales. Are you in need of
								employees? Focus on recruitment. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Focus on the actions that will yield the most results with the least amount of work.</span>
								Typically, that's sales.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>When I started my first company, I was so caught up in "being my own boss" and going to networking events (where my potential customers were) that I didn't
								even realize I was trying to do so much that I wasn't doing anything at all. I was trying to get our social media known, get customers, meet new people, find
								sales people, looking at every opportunity that knocked on my door and... I ended up in a stressed out state, worrying about money, customers, how I'd make it
								to that next event, why people aren't responding to our Facebook posts, trying to contact our manufacturer and getting our product out. Guess how that turned
								out? Well, this article isn't about the success of that company, that's for sure.</p>
								<p>Find out what is most important to you <span style="font-style: italic;">right now</span>&nbsp;and dedicate time to it. Don't get distracted. Don't focus
								on doing everything at once. Simply focus on one thing at a time.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>At Marketplace SuperHeroes, we don't even have a Twitter account, never mind a Facebook page. We have a Facebook group for our members and have built a
								community around that (I say we, I actually mean Stephen Somers did all that - and it was such a power decision!). We're completely focused on providing a
								great experience for our members, and building a software that makes their lives so much easier that we don't have time to make pointless Facebook posts that
								don't help us grow, or to Tweet meaningless inspiration pictures that most of our members won't see anyway.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>The lesson I've learned from the different startup scenes I've been involved in is to focus, prioritize and do just one thing. I'm a developer by nature,
								but I also have a couple online courses, mentor a few people here and there and take on a few web contracts for some extra play money. Or at least that's what
								I was doing last year. This year, I've completely focused on Marketplace SuperHeroes, and at first I actually lost money. But I kept at it with the founders,
								every day. And it's proven to work out quite favorably... for all of us.</p>
								<p>When you or your business start following the "trends", the only trend you'll end up truly following is failure.&nbsp;</p>
								<h3><a href="#focus" id="focus" name="focus"><i class="pull-right fa fa-anchor"></i></a> Know how
								to focus.</h3>
								<h4>A lesson on skill.</h4>
								<p>Not to beat the horse while the poor animal is down, but this is too important to not mention again. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Focus on one
								thing</span>. Focus on what you do best, and just do that. Can't manage everything alone? Good, don't. Find a co-founder, hire an employee, get some help in
								some way. Don't do it alone.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>At Marketplace SuperHeroes I do the coding. That's my primary role. I build the software and make it usable for our members. Robert Rickey and Stephen
								Somers have their roles too, both who are absolutely amazing at what they do!&nbsp;</p>
								<p>We all help when it comes to customer service and overall customer happiness, and we all have a hand in answering questions. But we all know our primary
								roles, and we stick to it. To me, that's probably the most important part of a team. We all get along quite well, but I think we'd be just as successful if we
								weren't friends, because we know how the team dynamic is supposed to work and which person does what.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>I've started other websites where I had to sell my own product or services and I 100% believe in what I've made. Does that make me a great salesman? Nope.
								It did result in some sales but not nearly as many as a dedicated and experienced marketer could do. In the same amount of time (say, 1 hour), I would have
								probably sold 1000% <span style="font-style: italic;">less</span>&nbsp;than what Robert and Stephen do. And in that time (1 hour, again), I can write 1000%
								more code than they can. My point is this: I can do sales but I'm much more successful when I stick to what I'm best at. This will be the same for you and
								your team.&nbsp;</p>
								<h3><a href="#role" id="role" name="role"><i class="pull-right fa fa-anchor"></i></a> Know what
								your role is.</h3>
								<h4>A lesson as a CEO and CTO.</h4>
								<p>First, let's just clarify what roles and titles are. Roles are what you do, titles are not. Titles lead to entitlement. That's why I say "Head of
								Software", or "CTO" or "That developer dude over there", or "The nerd at the laptop". Titles in a startup don't mean anything. Don't get hung up on them and
								don't let anyone around you get hung up on them. Roles, on the other hand, are what you actually do. My role is the developer - it's what I do, it's where my
								focus is and it's what I'm known for.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>At my first company I was the CEO. Was it nice to be at the top? You bet it was. Was I the best person for the role? No and yes. No because I wasn't CEO
								material yet; I had too much to learn still. And yes because I was the best fitted person for the position that I know of. That says something about my
								network back then, doesn't it?</p>
								<p>As a CEO, I was leading the entire company. At the time I didn't know anything about taxes, hiring employees, distribution, product management, product
								creation, customer life cycles, customer lifetimes and so on. But I learned very quickly. Still, that doesn't mean it was the best position for me. (I
								wouldn't have changed anything, though.) I spent <span style="font-style: italic;">most</span>&nbsp;of my time developing. Along side with sales, marketing,
								business, partnerships and the rest... over 60% of my countless 20-hour days were spent writing our platform. I didn't know it then, but that should have been
								a major wake up call to step down and go into a development role. After all, if Bill Gates can do it, anyone can do it (in regards to stepping down, not
								stepping up. Bill stepped down as CEO into a more "hands on" role).</p>
								<p>Today, I'm in more of a development role. CTO, developer, Head of Software... whatever you want to call it, I'm in the position where I spent 60% of my
								time as a CEO. I would say we are successful today because I'm <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span>&nbsp;in the CEO role. I'm in the role that I'm
								naturally great at. Will I ever be a CEO or founder again? Probably some day. But for now I need to live in an epiphany I had at the beginning of 2014.</p>
								<p>Just because you <span style="font-style: italic;">can</span>&nbsp;be in a role, doesn't mean you <span style="font-style: italic;">should</span>&nbsp;be
								in that role. Do what you do best and contribute as much as you can in the way you know how, and the role will find you.</p>
