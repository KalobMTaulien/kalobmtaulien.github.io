								<p>It's not too often you get to say, "I'm thankful for all the mistakes I've made" -- and this is not one of those times. I spent some time recently
								pondering about all the time I've spent making mistakes in general, but mostly in the field of web development.</p>


								<p>I've been making websites and web services for the better part of two decades and guess what? I'm still making mistakes. They aren't the same mistakes, but
								they are variations of the origins still. But that's growth, and that's the lesson in the post.</p>


								<p>We've all done our fair share of Googling answers and trying what somebody on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> suggests. But have you
								ever noticed when answers come to you easily, you tend to forget them? That's because there's something special about the struggle you go through when you
								learn something new and difficult.</p>


								<p>So let's talk about said struggle.</p>


								<p>First, it sucks. This is coming from a person who loves to learn, and by nature, must learn. It's unnatural for me to not learn something new every day.
								That said, I face this struggle every day and I can tell you - it does not get sweeter, it does not go away and it tends to always be around, even after you
								accomplish something amazing, it will find you and it will force you to learn the hard way.</p>


								<p>Second, it's the best way to learn. I know, I know, "Kalob, there's a learning pyramid that shows you how much you absorb based on the type of learning."
								You'll rarely find yourself forgetting anything when it's bundled with a bunch of challenges that stress your face off. You'll forget videos, articles,
								lectures, speeches and even actions unless you need to fight for it. Think about a skill you have but took a long time to acquire. You're probably a pro at
								whatever it is you do. And in said time, how many challenges were you faced with? That's rhetorical - the answer is <em>lots</em>.</p>


								<p>So next time you find yourself hating a task that you can't figure out, maybe take a step back and re-enter the situation with a fresh mindset because once
								you get through the hard part, you'll <em>know</em> something that most people just don't understand. But also know, that with progress, comes adversity,
								meaning you'll be seeing more difficult challenges.</p>


								<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying you need to learn the hard way, I'm simply saying that whatever you're going through is not as bad as it seems... Once
								you get through it. In many cases it actually seems straight forward and almost like common sense, but that's part of the skill or knowledge you've acquired
								from learning the hard way.</p>


								<p>Now, I don't want you to leave this blog empty handed. You should know this one little trick that comes in extremely handy -- especially if you're young
								(turn this into a habit if you can).</p>


								<blockquote>
									All humans learn by making mistakes. It's in our nature, it's hard coded into our DNA. There's nothing we can do to change that. <em>But they don't need to
									be your mistakes</em>
								</blockquote>


								<p>Pick up a book, watch videos on YouTube, read forums, ask questions and talk to other people about situations you're in. Learn from other peoples mistakes.
								You'll still need to practice when you've learned, but going into something new, or something advanced, knowing how to handle mistakes that other people have
								made will literally save you years of stress.</p>


								<p>This was a mistake I made for the first 9 years of my web development career. I didn't learn from other programmers - I forced the struggle on myself and
								made it harder than it needed to be. Don't make the same mistake; leverage the knowledge that other people share to help get yourself further ahead in less
								time.</p>
